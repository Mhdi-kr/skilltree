# Frontend Development Skill Tree

## What is this repo about?

This repo is my honest endeavour to build a skill tree for frontend development. I'm trying to come up with a skill tree that is as broad as possible, but still as specific as possible.

## The problem with road maps

Road maps are great for describing the order of steps taken in a project or a tutorial, but real life does not work like that in my opinion, for example in the infamous web development road map repo there's git and source control step in the very beginning of the road map.

my real life did not start with git! I started web development messing around with pure HTML. not even a single line of js code was written! I did not consider myself proficient in git until my second or third job! so I think those do not represent my real life.

In my opinion real life is much more like a tree, where you can go from a root node to any leaf node if you wanted! you can choose to learn a little bit HTML and css and decide to go and learn more about js without anyone forcing you to learn git (or any arbitrary technology) first.

This is less overwhelming, and I think that's the value I want to bring to people with this repo.

tired of learning react hooks? why don't you  hop onto CSS and animations to spice things up?
